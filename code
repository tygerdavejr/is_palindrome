"""This lab prompts the user to input a word, and then checks to see if it is
a palindrome.  Any spaces or non-letters are to be ignored, as well as upper
and lower case.  This is to be a function that takes a string and returns True
if it is a palindrome, and returns False if it is not."""

# INITIALIZING
# Import libraries, define functions and set variables as needed

test_word = ''  # Set the test_world string to null value


def is_palindrome(word_to_test):
    """This function takes the word to test, pushes each letter to the 
    simulated stack, then pops the last letter one at a time to compare with
    the word_to_test.  It will set the appropriate result value and return
    to be displayed."""
    return (palindrome_result)  # True or False

def pre_process_word(word_to_test):
    """This function prompts the user for a word and then processes it before
    passing to the is_palindrome function.  Non-letters are to be stripped out
    and convert every letter to a single case."""

# PROCESSING
# Set variables, call functions

test_word = str(input('Please enter a word to test:'))  
# Force a string value if the user inputs nothing but numbers

word_to_test = pre_process_word(test_word)
# Strip non-letter characters, convert to upper case

result = is_palindrome(palindrome_result)
# Determine if our test word is a palindrome


# TERMINATION
# Print a results message

print(f'The test word {test_word} is a palindrome: {result}')
# Nothing fancy here, just a True or False result
